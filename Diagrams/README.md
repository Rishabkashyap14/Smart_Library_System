# UML Diagrams 
The folder consists of a list of six UML diagrams that describe the basic architecture as well as the working of our environment.

## What are UML diagrams?
Unified Modeling Language, abbreviated as UML, can be defined to be a developmental concept in the field of software engineering, which defines the different ways in which a system in development can be visualized. Each of these visualizations highlight certain aspects of the system in development, and give us a clear understanding of:
1. The Requirements for the development
	- This includes Functional requirements which describe the functions of various components in the system
	- Non-functional requirements used to assess any extra or external factors or tools required for the system  
2. Aiding the Software Develoment Life Cycle
3. Overall steps for development and testing of the systems  
In this case, we have made use of 6 of the most popular diagrams.
