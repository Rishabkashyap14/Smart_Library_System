# Smart Library System
This is a simple Object Oriented Application that follows the rules of Software Engineering and Design. The project consists of simple functionalities such as addition of books, removal of books, issue/return then and even display the information of existing books.

## What does it consists of?
1. Front-End: HTML, CSS, JS
2. Middleware: NodeJS
3. Backend: C++
4. Database: SQLite

## Executing the application
- The Application currently works on Linux Systems and MacOS systems as some of the functionalities weren't supported for Windows.
- Clone the repository if required onto your system, or simply download the 'frontend' folder onto the local system. Make sure that you have apache running on your server in order to access the localhost.
- Traverse into the frontend folder and move into the 'Common' folder. Once there run:  
						`node Node.js`  
and move to your localhost. Feel free to change the ports if necessary!  
- You will enter the Home Page first with a dropdown option. Feel free to explore on from here!
